# Sentinel 2352 Investigation

This repository contains code and analysis investigating whether language models use structured reasoning mechanisms, specifically focusing on deepseek r1 distilled llama 3.1 8b

## Notebooks

- **model_inference_colab.ipynb**: 
  - Code for running inference using DeepSeek R1 Distill LLaMA 3.1 8B on NuminaMath dataset.
  - Contains activation detection and ablation experiments.

- **explore_data.ipynb**: 
  - Detailed analysis of activation patterns and ablation results.
  - Generates key graphs and metrics presented in the application.

## How to Run
1. `model_inference_colab.ipynb` to reproduce inference experiments.
2. We can directly use the generated data in `explore_data.ipynb` for analyzing and visualizing results.
